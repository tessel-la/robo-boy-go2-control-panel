# robo-boy-go2-control-panel: agent guide

Read [README.md](README.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and the guide for the area you change.
Maintainers with a sibling `../tessella-handbook/` checkout also read its `AGENTS.md` and routed pages.
Public contributions do not require access to that private handbook; the rules below apply independently.

## Workflow

- Integration branch: `dev`; release branch: `main`. Create topic branches from `dev` and target PRs there. Before the first remote `dev` exists, maintainers establish it from `main`.
- Use `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `ci/`, `test/`, `perf/`, or `refactor/` prefixes. No `codex/` or other tool prefixes.
- Use Conventional Commits with lowercase subjects. Do not add tool-attribution footers or `Co-Authored-By` trailers.
- Do not commit, push, open/merge PRs, publish, or deploy unless the user authorized that action. Preserve existing work.
- Inspect types, runtime, tests, and configuration before editing. Update matching docs with behavior changes.
- Never commit secrets, weaken validation, or change a trust boundary to make a check pass.

## Boundaries

Keep the stable panel ID, exact ROS grants, Panel API v2 sandbox, and type-only SDK boundary.
Use only Robo-Boy runtime theme variables. Release subscriptions on inactivity/reconnect/unmount;
never resume held input after reconnect. Recompute SRI after every bundle change.

## Checks

Run from the repository root; the README explains prerequisites and complete runtime setup.

```bash
npm ci
npm run release:prepare
```

Report what changed, exact checks and their results, and anything not verified. Passing unit tests
are not proof of live ROS, GPU, browser, or hardware behavior. Releases follow [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md).
